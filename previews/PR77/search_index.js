Typical contributions include fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving the documentation (either in source code or the online manual).\n\nBelow we give some general comments about contributing to this package. The JuliaReach development documentation describes coding guidelines; take a look when in doubt about the coding style that is expected for the code that is finally merged into the library.","category":"section"},{"location":"about/#Branches-and-pull-requests-(PR)","page":"About","title":"Branches and pull requests (PR)","text":"We use a standard pull request policy: You work in a private branch and eventually add a pull request, which is then reviewed by other programmers and merged into the master branch.\n\nEach pull request should be pushed in a new branch with the name of the author followed by a descriptive name, e.g., mforets/my_feature. If the branch is associated to a previous discussion in an issue, we use the name of the issue for easier lookup, e.g., mforets/7.","category":"section"},{"location":"about/#Unit-testing-and-continuous-integration-(CI)","page":"About","title":"Unit testing and continuous integration (CI)","text":"This project is synchronized with GitHub Actions such that each PR gets tested before merging (and the build is automatically triggered after each new commit).
